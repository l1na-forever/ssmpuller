ssmpuller
================

Generates a systemd EnvironmentFile from [AWS Systems Manager parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html).

## Installation

To install via [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/):

    cargo install ssmpuller

To install from source, first, [install Rust](https:://rustup.rs/), and then run:

    git clone github.com/l1na-forever/ssmpuller
    cd ssmpuller
    cargo install

**Binary releases can be found on the [Releases page](https://github.com/l1na-forever/ssmpuller/releases/).**

## Usage

To get help, run the command:

    ssmpuller --help

To generate a [systemd EnvironmentFile](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#EnvironmentFile=) from secure parameters stored in SSM:

    ssmpuller /etc/myservice/myservice.conf MY_API_KEY

This will generate a file that can be used to set environment variables via the `EnvironmentFile=` directive. An example file might look like:

    MY_API_KEY='secret_token_goes_here'

To make use of the generated file as part of a [systemd service unit](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html), set the `EnvironmentFile=` directive:

    [Unit]
    Description=Example systemd service

    [Service]
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/myservice
    EnvironmentFile=/etc/myservice/myservice.conf

`ssmpuller`'s intended usage is to bootstrap an instance's long-lived, static credentials (e.g., 3rd-party API keys) at provision time, using the IAM instance role. Wherever possible, make use of a temporary/federated credentials and the instance role credentials to make service calls. Do **not** use `ssmpuller` to manage any AWS credentials; [**use IAM instance roles instead**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html).

## Status

`ssmpuller` is considered feature-complete, and is offered as-is. Bug reports and pull requests are most welcome!
